# Summary
The **UD_French-GSD** was converted in 2015 from the content head version of the universal
dependency treebank v2.0 (https://github.com/ryanmcd/uni-dep-tb).
It is updated since 2015 independently from the previous source.

# Introduction
The **UD_French-GSD** is converted from the content head version of the universal
dependency treebank v2.0 (https://github.com/ryanmcd/uni-dep-tb).
The README for the original project is available below.

The version 2.7 of **UD_French-GSD** data consists of 400,399 words (16,341 sentences).
No sentence id were available in the original resource, so new `sent_id` were automatically introduced in the converted corpus with prefixes `fr-ud-train`, `fr-ud-dev` and `fr-ud-test` on the corresponding original files, followed by a 5 digit number following the order of sentences in the original files.

:warning: to meet the size requirements of test data of 10K words, a part of the dev original file was moved to the test file!
Since version 2.0, the splitting of data is:

 * file `fr-ud-train.conll`: 14,449 sentences; 354,662 words
  * `fr-ud-train_00001` to `fr-ud-train_14554`
 * file `fr-ud-dev.conll`: 1,476 sentences; 35,718 words
  * `fr-ud-dev_00001` to `fr-ud-dev_01478`
 * file `fr-ud-test.conll`: 416 sentences; 10,019 words
  * `fr_ud-test_00001` to `fr_ud-test_00298`
  * `fr-ud-dev_01479` to `fr-ud-dev_01596`

Sentences are shuffled and there is no way to know what is the source or the genre of a given sentence.

Probably due to some bug in a conversion program, version 1.2 contains many truncated sentences (date missing for instance).
Almost every truncated sentence are from Wikipedia, so it was possible to recover the original text.
Most of the truncated sentences were completed in version 1.3. Some sentences were completed later.
There are probably still some truncated sentences.

Automatic modifications and consistency checking were partly done using the [Grew software](http://grew.fr).

# Changelog

* 2024-11-15 v2.15
  * Construction annotations in the [UCxn](https://github.com/LeonieWeissweiler/UCxn) framework added to MISC
  
     This release adds rule-based annotations of Interrogatives, Conditionals, Existentials, and NPN (noun-preposition-noun) constructions on the head of the respective phrase, plus construction elements. The UCxn v1 notation and categories are documented [here](https://github.com/LeonieWeissweiler/UCxn/blob/main/docs/UCxn-v1.pdf).

* 2024-05-15 v2.14
  * Fix validation warnings on flat:foreign
  * Fix many NOUN wrongly tagged as PROPN

* 2020-11-15 v2.7
  New conversion from [SUD data](https://github.com/surfacesyntacticud/SUD_French-GSD/tree/r2.7).

* 2020-05-15 v2.6
  * **UD_French-GSD** is now maintained in the [SUD format](https://surfacesyntacticud.github.io/) and converter to UD with the [Grew](http://grew.fr)-based conversion system [SUD_to_UD](https://github.com/surfacesyntacticud/tools/tree/master/converter).

* 2019-11-15 v2.5
  * Google gave permission to drop the "NC" restriction from the license.
    This applies to the UD annotations (not the underlying content, of which Google claims no ownership or copyright).
  * Many corrections:
     * expletive annotation with relations `expl:subj`, `expl:comp` and `expl:pass`
     * `aux` -> `aux:tense`
     * `MWEPOS` -> `EXTPOS`
     * systematic review of non-projective trees
     * improved ellipsis annotations
* 2019-05-15 v2.4
  * Change annotations to make the corpus valid
  * Change MWE annotations (see [here](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_French-GSD/blob/dev/not-to-release/README.md))
* 2018-11-15 v2.3
  * add subtyping for preposition "à"
  * remove duplicate sentences
  * fix errors found with conversion to SUD
* 2018-04-15 v2.2
  * Partial subtyping of `obl` into the 3 relations `obl:agent`, `obl:mod` and `obl:arg` (This is done form 43,5% of the total number of the `obl` relations; this is completely done from PP introduced by prepositions *de*, *par*, *dans* and *avec*).
  * Many error corrections
* 2017-11-15 v2.1
  * Only "être", "avoir" or "faire" with the POS tag `AUX`
  * modifications taking into account new decisions taken for harmonisation of several French Treebanks (causative, copulas, auxiliaries, change of `nmod:poss` in `det`)
* 2017-03-01 v2.0
  * Conversion of data to follow new guidelines (automatic conversions with manual verifications and manual annotation of `nmod` VS `obl` in ambiguous cases)
* 2016-11-15 v.1.4
  * POS annotations were made more consistent
  * Several dependency paths were also made more consistent across similar expressions
  * Only "avoir" and "être" are considered copula
* 2016-05-15 v1.3
  * Add lemmas and features
  * Complete truncated sentences
* 2015-11-15 v1.2
  * Add sent_id and full text in metadata
